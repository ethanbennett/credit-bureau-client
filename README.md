# Blockchain Credit Bureau

This is the client app for our entry in the [Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition Hackathon](https://www.blockchainforsocialimpact.com/hackathon/) (in the financial inclusion category). It interacts with smart contracts deployed to the Rinkeby testnet and written in Solidity. The blockchain functionality is completely abstracted from the end user.

You can check out our contracts [here](https://github.com/njgheorghita/bureau).
